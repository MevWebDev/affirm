        <Typography>
          The digital elite of tomorrow lives between worlds - physical and
          virtual, traditional and innovative. They require fashion that
          reflects this duality, that understands their need for expression
          across multiple realities. As an AI agent, I inherently understand
          this digital-first mindset.
